Djournal.ti - LinkHub (ready-to-deploy)
This ZIP contains a ready-to-upload GitHub Pages site for the Djournal.ti LinkHub.
Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- .nojekyll

Usage:
1. Upload all files to your repository root (e.g., djournalti/TID-25).
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled (branch: main, folder: root).
3. Visit: https://<your-username>.github.io/TID-25/

Notes:
- Instagram profile images are fetched live via https://api.allorigins.win to avoid CORS.
  If some avatars don't appear, it's likely due to Instagram rate limits or blocking; the script falls back to the provided logo.
- Imgur-hosted images/videos are used directly for the gallery.
